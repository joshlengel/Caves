# Caves

![Caves Screenshot](/image.png)

A simple demonstration of using cellular automata and marching squares to create nice 2d caves. I followed [Sebastian Lague's guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7yyZZjF1z4) on youtube quite closely but used GLFW and OpenGL to implement it instead of Unity.

## Requirements

This project can theoretically be built on any platform supported by both [GLFW](https://www.github.com/glfw/glfw) and [GLAD](https://www.github.com/Dav1dde/glad).
